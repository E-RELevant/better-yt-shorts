# Better YouTube Shorts

You can control your YouTube shorts with playback controls just like a normal YouTube video!

## Download

* Chrome Extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-youtube-shorts/icnidlkdlledahfgejnagmhgaeijokcp
* Firefox Add-on: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-youtube-shorts

## Features
* Seeking 5 seconds forward and backward with J and L respectively
* Mini timestamp above the like button

## Future Implementation
This is a very new extension so feel free to make suggestions. I might not have the time to develop the extension extensively so PR are welcomed!
* Bug: Navigating to YouTube shorts from a page may not trigger the extension
* Bug: Typing in search bar also triggers seeking
* Feature: Slider bar
