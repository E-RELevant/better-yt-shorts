## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice: Chrome Web Store Policy Violation

We're working on bringing the extension back due to the violation of the use of YouTube Shorts logo. The new version is submitted for review and hopefully will be updated as soon as possible.

2. Extract the zip file
3. Go to the "Manage extensions" page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable developer mode by clicking the button at the top right corner
5. Drag the unzipped folder (make sure the contents are the file and not another folder) into the page
6. **OR** Click load unpacked and select the `manifest.json` file in the unzipped folder

## üôå Version 3 is in Beta!
Test out the latest version at the [v3 branch](https://github.com/ynshung/better-yt-shorts/tree/v3). Simply clone the repository, install the dependencies, start development mode and load the `dist` folder unpackaged. Feel free to leave or report any bugs, suggestion or improvement for this version. Your help is greatly appreciated!
