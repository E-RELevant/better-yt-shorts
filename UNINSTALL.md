# Leaving so soon?

We're sad to see you go! It would be great if you could let us know why you're uninstalling the extension by leaving feedback below.

## ⚠️ Notice: Chrome Web Store Policy Violation

We're working on bringing the extension back due to the violation of the use of YouTube Shorts logo. The new version is submitted for review and hopefully will be updated as soon as possible. The current workaround is to load the extension right from this GitHub repository and the steps are provided below. We thank you for your patience.

### Guide to load the extension manually (unpacked)

1. Click the "<> Code" green button and click "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the zip file
3. Go to the "Manage extensions" page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable developer mode by clicking the button at the top right corner
5. Drag the unzipped folder (make sure the contents are the file and not another folder) into the page
6. **OR** Click load unpacked and select the `manifest.json` file in the unzipped folder
